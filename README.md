BeFocusedApp
============

Chrome App to refocus yourself, integrates with Asana

## Description

Stay focused with Asana, by always seeing which task you are working on.

Simple way to allow yourself to really focus on your work. With this app, you'll always see (no matter what application you're using) the name of the selected task. Uses Asana as backend.
Shows tasks assigned to you, picked for TODAY. Aside from that, you can use it to complete those tasks, or quickly add new ones, that you want to focus on now.
Navigation within the app is simple, and mirrors full Asana:

* ctrl + enter - completes the task
* up/down arrows - next/previous task
* typing - updates current task's name
* enter - adds new task

You will need to provide your API key, available from http://app.asana.com/-/account_api

If you want the app to take up even less space, you can toggle the header (but you won't be able to move it unless you toggle it back - for now).

I might implement OAuth in the future.

## Example usage:

The way I use it, is to add many tiny tasks as I go and work, so that whenever I get distracted, I can just look at it and see what I am supposed to work on at that very moment. If I make a daily task plan before work, as I complete the task, I will automatically see what's the next thing I should be working on, without switching back to Asana.

If you have any comments, feel free to write me a note at: befocused (at) amplifuge.com or leave a review.

I might integrate time tracking in the future, if time permits.
